# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
---

## Introduction 

This case study investigates how casual riders and annual members use the Cyclistic (a bike-sharing company) service differently. The analyzed dataset originates from the [Divvy Bike Share System Data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data), which is publicly available under a data license agreement provided by [Motivate International Inc](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data analysis and data visualizations were conducted in R.

## Business Problem

The executive team at Cyclistic wants to convert casual customers into annual subscribers to drive profitability. Therefore, they are seeking my data-driven insights to design new marketing strategies for this purpose. I identified two business problems: 

A. How do annual subscribers and casual customers use bikes differently?
  
B. What insights from these differences can drive marketing strategy?

Data suggests thatï¼š

1. On average, casual customers took significantly longer rides (Mean = 76.93 minutes) than annual subscribers (Mean = 12.11 minutes). A Gamma regression model indicated a strong negative effect of being an annual subscriber, where their average ride lengths were about 64% shorter than those of casual customers (p < .001).
   
2. Overall, annual subscribers take  significantly more ride trips (Mean = 720,313) than casual customers (Mean = 71,526). A Poisson regression model indicated a strong positive effect of being an annual subscriber, where annual subscribers took about 10.07 times more trips than casual customers (p < .001).

## Solutions 
Recommendation: Create an incentivized subscriber plan for longer rides
Since casual customers tend to ride for longer durations, we can create sign-up bonuses for annual membership that reward longer riding. For instance, if you aggregate 60 minutes of total ride time, you can purchase an annual membership at a discounted rate or earn free trips by signing up. 

Pros: Specifically targeted for casual customers

Cons: Limit reach for infrequent riders in general

## Conclusions 
Casual customers used Cyclistic less frequently, but whenever they ride, they tend to ride longer than annual subscribers. Therefore, by tokenizing longer ride time as a sign-up incentive, the new marketing strategy can effectively target customers who already knew and used Cyclistic, and introduce a stronger desire for them to rely on Cyclistic more.
