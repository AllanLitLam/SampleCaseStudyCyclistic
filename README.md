## Business Problem

The executive team at Cyclistic wants to convert casual riders into annual members to drive profitability. Therefore, they are seeking my data-driven insights to design new marketing strategies for this purpose. I identified two business problems: 

A. How do annual members and casual riders use bikes differently?
  
B. What insights from these differences can drive marketing strategy?

Data suggests thatï¼š

1. On average, casual riders took significantly longer rides (Mean = 76.93 minutes) than annual members (Mean = 12.11 minutes). A Gamma regression model indicated a strong negative effect of being an annual member, where their average ride lengths were about 64% shorter than those of casual riders (p < .001).
   
2. Overall, annual members take  significantly more ride trips (Mean = 720,313) than casual riders (Mean = 71,526). A Poisson regression model indicated a strong positive effect of being an annual member, where annual members took about 10.07 times more trips than casual riders (p < .001).
